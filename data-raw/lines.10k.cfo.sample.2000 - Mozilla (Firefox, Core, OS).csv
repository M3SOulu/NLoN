That is, if IME sends WM_IME_COMPOSITION -> WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION -> WM_IME_ENDCOMPOSITION, we cannot handle WM_IME_COMPOSITION by the previous patch. So, this patch also checks whether both WM_IME_STARTCOMPOSITION and WM_IME_COMPOSITION messages are coming or not. I think that lParam check isn't needed by this check because even if we ignore the strange WM_IME_COMPOSITION message unexpectedly, we can recover at the next WM_IME_COMPOSITION message."

With this patch, if any of the sides may need a coercion while the other element is a float32, then we set the correct type of comparison during type inferring.
