The react native app (expo sdk version 21.0.0) is a simple webview wrapper that redirects to our web app. When the user is filling out their form, as soon as they click on an input field, the screen scrolls to the top and then gets stuck up there. I'll post a video below that illustrates the bug in detail. The bug is only present through the react native app. If the user visits the url through a web browser the form is fine. The bug is also only present on some devices (works on iphone/blackberry but, broken on Samsung). Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!!!",NL,NL

I'm also using Expo.Audio that has onPlaybackStatusUpdate to update the state of the audio object. foo uses one of the audio's states. What is the best way to handle this? I'm worried it'll use up a lot of unnecessary data/will cause performance issue.",NL,NL
